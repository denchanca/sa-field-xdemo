# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Ledgerly

Fictional billing ops SaaS. Fieldnote Workspace. Operator Avery Quinn. No auth. No real companies.

Catalog prices are frozen: Starter **$49**, Growth **$99**, Scale **$249**. Never invent a fourth price, live ARR, or a real customer name.

This is a **Cursor demo app**. Advanced workflow prompts live in `lib/workflows/meta.ts` and render at `/workflows`. Project subagents live in `.cursor/agents/`. Dispatch skills live in `.cursor/skills/`.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Install

```bash
npm i
npx prisma generate
```

`.cursor/environment.json` runs that on setup.

### Seed

SQLite file is `prisma/dev.db` (gitignored). Schema URL is hardcoded in `prisma/schema.prisma` as `file:./dev.db`. No `.env` required.

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

The seed script runs `prisma db push` first, then reloads deterministic Fieldnote data. Safe to re-run. Demo clock is **2026-08-23**.

### Dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Listens on **43173** (not 3000).

### Tests

```bash
npm test
```

One test is intentionally failing. Do not change `tests/dispute-credit.test.ts` or `lib/dispute-credit.ts` unless the user asked to cap suggested credit. Do not change the seed.

Passing tests include `tests/money.test.ts` and `tests/plans.test.ts`. Environment start seeds the database and runs only the passing tests so a red suite cannot mark the machine as failed to boot.

Shipped suite on a clean tree: **1 failed / 9 passed**.

### Multi-file stub (leave it unless asked)

Incomplete on purpose:

- `lib/disputes/resolve.ts`
- `app/api/disputes/[id]/resolve/route.ts`
- `app/disputes/[id]/page.tsx` (resolution panel)

### Product constraints

- Prices only from `lib/plans.ts`.
- Customer names only from `prisma/seed.ts` and `prisma/extra-accounts.ts`.
- Comments in code must not cite Slack, GitHub, or Jira URLs.
- Do not rename Collections / Nudge / Pulse / Slatebook / Harborbill, and never reintroduce retired pre-remap names.
- Do not add Deno workflows or GitHub Actions starters. Do not add better-sqlite3.
- Do not add talk-track / speaker-note skills. Do not add a fourth catalog-solving agent. Workflow prompts live in `lib/workflows/meta.ts`.
