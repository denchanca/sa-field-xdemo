- app/api/disputes/route.ts and app/api/disputes/[id]/route.ts
- app/api/mock/nudge/route.ts
- app/api/mock/pulse/route.ts

A shared helper may live under lib/. Each worker starts with clean context; the dispatch prompt must name the files, the helper, and the constraint.

Stop and ask if branch intent is ambiguous or a billing, security, privacy, migration, or concurrency comment needs judgment.
